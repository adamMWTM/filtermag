She had started work on her second album, as a baccalaureate project for her graduation from the Catalonia College of Music. Funding the project herself, Rosalía collaborated with producer and songwriter Pablo Diaz-Reixa, aka El Guincho, and Spanish rapper C. Tangana, to create an adventurous mixture of flamenco, pop, Latin, hip-hop, R&B, and other music styles. 
                                            </p>
                                                
                                            <p>
                                                However, by the time the recordings were completed, Rosalía had run out of money. She could either finish her baccalaureate project as cheaply as possible, or she could aim for the sky. She chose the latter and the results were spectacular. The resulting album, El Mal Querer, released in November 2018, became her international breakthrough. It earned her a Grammy Award for Best Latin, Rock, Urban or Alternative Album, plus four Latin Grammy Awards. 
                                            </p>
                                            
                                            <p>
                                                The key to the enormous success of the album lay in the lead single, “Malamente,” a minimalist, ultra-catchy mashup of flamenco, pop and urban music. It went platinum in several countries, including Spain and the US, and was honored with five Latin Grammy Awards, including Record of the Year, Song of the Year, Best Short Form Music Video, Best Urban Fusion Performance and Best Alternative Song, winning the last two. “Malamente” was a huge critical and cultural success, and became one of the most influential Latin songs of the 2010s.

                                                While it’s difficult to gauge the specific impact of any one of the people involved in the making of “Malamente” and El Mal Querer, Rosalía’s international breakthrough might well not have happened were it not for the contributions of one star participant. Exactly why Rosalía, in reaching for the sky, reached for the services of elite mixer Jaycen Joshua is unknown. But it is likely that his mix  of the original version of Luis Fonsi’s monster hit “Despacito” - done a year earlier - alerted her to Joshua’s talent for mixing Latin music. 
                                            </p>
                                            
                                            <p>
                                                By 2018, Joshua was well-established as one of the world’s leading mixers. After stints as an A&R man and in advertising, he became an intern at Larrabee Studios in 2003. He eventually graduated to assist Dave Pensado, at the time one of the world’s top mixers. The two hit it off, and eventually collaborated on equal terms under the name The Penua Project. Today, in 2023, Joshua has won 3 Grammy Awards, and his credits include Beyoncé, Nicki Minaj, The Weeknd, Pop Smoke, Ed Sheeran, Rihanna, and many more. 
                                            </p>

                                                Back in 2018, Joshua was mixing tracks for the likes of Rita Ora, The-Dream, BTS, NAV and Future. One day an unusual suggestion landed on his desk. In a video with Mix With The Masters, Joshua recalls the <a href="https://mixwiththemasters.com/videos/jaycen-joshua-rosalia-malamente/part/1?at=37" target="_blank"><b>first time he heard of Rosalía</b></a>. Apparently, Latin star Juanes and Rosalía had become friends, and the Columbian singer had alerted his manager, Rebecca Leon to her talents. 
                                            </p>
                                            
                                            <p>
                                                Joshua recalls, “Rebecca said to me, ‘I have a unicorn for you.’ And I said, ‘Well, who is that?’ She said, ‘Rosalía.’ I said, ‘Okay, can I hear the music?’ The first song and the only song they played was ‘Malamente,’ and I felt like a shock wave hit me because I’d never heard anything like that. To infuse something as creative and historic as flamenco with hip-hop drums… at the time, people couldn’t process it.”
                                            </p>
                                            
                                            <p>
                                                “I hadn’t met the unicorn yet, but I decided to mix the song anyway. I jumped on the chance to be a part of Rosalía’s vision and dream. She wasn’t signed to a label, and basically financed everything herself. So I said, ‘Since you brought me the gift of this song, let me return the gift and do this mix for you for no charge.’ They were so appreciative and happy and crying at the same time. And I put my heart and soul into it.” 
                                            </p>

                                                Joshua ended up mixing the whole of El Mal Querer, starting with “Malamente.” The song has a very minimalist arrangement, featuring only Rosalia’s lead, background vocals, and handclaps augmented by a Herreño drum (tambora), an 808, a rimshot, and a few synths tracks, courtesy of producer Pablo Diaz-Reixha, who also sang some of the ad libs vocals.

                                                “The first part of my mix process,” comments Joshua, “was understanding how important <a href="https://mixwiththemasters.com/videos/jaycen-joshua-rosalia-malamente/part/1?at=198" target="_blank"><b>the claps</b></a> were. In flamenco, claps are everything. When you pay attention to the claps in this track, you feel a rhythmic pattern that's both perfectly in time and not in time, and not forced. I took longer to truncate the claps and find that pocket, because the mix is so minimal. She did everything by hand, and I wanted to find that groove because there’s no hi-hat, there’s no other percussion. The clap, and the tambora, are the entire rhythm section of the track. The whole vibe of the record, the whole purpose, was to make sure that people didn’t stop nodding to a flamenco record!”

                                                “So I took my time with that, and once I got the claps right, I immediately bypassed everything and went to <a href="https://mixwiththemasters.com/videos/jaycen-joshua-rosalia-malamente/part/1?at=298" target="_blank"><b>Rosalía’s vocal</b></a>, which is the foundation of her super stardom. In this track, the claps and her vocal are everything. Her lead vocal is very seductive, and I didn’t want to just lay a bunch of standard reverb and delays on it that are linear all the way through. I wanted a moving vocal where each syllable or maybe each word or even chorus has a different texture, a different vibe, to make them explode through the track.”

                                                “There are six tracks with these ‘explosions.’  I had a lot more, but Rosalía reminded me of the intimacy that she wanted on the record. So I had to dial some of them back and I started to understand her perspective of the record. She wanted something really intimate, and when we did do the explosions on certain words and ad libs and catch phrases, each became a moment, instead of a bunch of moments.”

                                                Joshua’s former mentor, <a href="https://mixwiththemasters.com/videos/jaycen-joshua-rosalia-malamente/part/1?at=403" target="_blank"><b>Dave Pensado</b></a>, is also present in the Mix With The Masters series, and offers a number of pertinent observations and questions. Pensado notes, “the groove is spectacular. The first time I heard the song and the claps, the way you truncate them, is just priceless. The groove is this close to monotonous, but you made it hypnotic. And that’s a hard thing to do. And you used the ad libs in a really amazing way. They have tons of extra effects on them which put them back in the mix, and make Rosalia’s lead vocal sound farther to the front. Was that intentional?” 
                                            </p>
                                            
                                            <p>
                                               “Absolutely,” confirms Joshua. “But first of all, I’d like to stress, sometimes you have to get out of your own way, especially when you get a record that’s pretty much there. I didn’t get goosebumps when I first heard this record for no reason. A lot of people can become too heavy-handed, but sometimes you just have to step back and understand you were given a gift and just let that gift fly on its own, and you just help it in certain areas.”

                                            <p>
                                                “It’s always best that the people you’re working with hear the music the same way that you do. Rosalía and I did not have a dialogue before I mixed the record, but fortunately, I got lucky in that she and I heard the record the same. When she called me after my first mix, she was ecstatic, and her notes were very minimal. The end result is pretty much the director’s cut.”
                                            </p>

                                                Joshua adds that his main focus, in addition to the claps and the vocals, was to “bring low end and credibility to the record. To me it sounds like Rosalía grew up on hip-hop, and I believe one of the producers, Pablo, who is a genius, was influenced by hip-hop culture as well. I think that was a major factor for them to involve someone like me, who has a solid grip of hip-hop culture.”

                                                Joshua’s original mix was performed on an SSL desk, but for the Mix With The Masters series he re-created it <a href="https://mixwiththemasters.com/videos/jaycen-joshua-rosalia-malamente" target="_blank"><b>inside the box</b></a>, to be able to demonstrate the techniques he used. In the video Joshua is able to give a much more complete and comprehensive breakdown of his mix than is possible in this article, but below a few highlights of some of the most essential aspects, first returning to his treatments of the lead vocal and ad libs. 
                                            </p>
                                            
                                            <p>
                                                “One of my primary things is that I want to make sure that a vocal is heard before you hear any reverb or delay. I love hitting with the dry vocal first. Sometimes you put a short room or a slap on it, but it’s primarily dry without any wet reverb, and then maybe 20 to 40 to 60ms later, there’s a group of reverbs adding the texture, vibe and ambiance.” 
                                            </p>

                                                The lead vocals in the “Malamente” session are grouped in two aux tracks, VRS Lead and HK Lead. Both tracks feed into what Joshua calls his "basic vocal chain". It consists on the inserts of the Avid Lo-Fi, Waves RVox, Fabfilter Pro-Q (x2), McDSP MC404, Waves CLA Vocals, Waves C6 multi-band compressor (x3), and FabFilter Pro-DS. There also are sends to five aux effects tracks: AirFrance, Rap Verb, EMTCrispy, Lex Hall and Chamber.

I love the Push setting on the compressor when it’s subtle, and I love the Spank setting on a good rap local to give it attention. The Top setting on the Treble is beautiful, but I usually never EQ too much. I tend to set it to +1, because it gives it a little lift. I think Top setting hits the 5K to 8k range. Then there’s the Sub on the Bass fader. There obviously is no sub in the vocal whatsoever, but it adds some body."

After that I like to scoop out a little bit of the low mids [with the McDSP Filterband E606]. Then there’s the Rap Verb send, which adds a short almost unnoticeable reverb from LiquidSonics VerbSuite Classics. It’s the Hall C1, which is a grainy, higher frequency reverb.”

I’m specifically selecting this or any reverb to give me a certain frequency that I think is needed, or that brings excitement, or the opposite; if some top end is scooped out it gives you a sense of, ‘Oh, I feel that it's spacious, but I don't detect the verb,’ because you're taking away that first high-end frequency that usually gets picked up by the ear. I love dark reverbs and delays to give the vocal a sense of character.”

And then we take our time trying to find the best things to bring out those moments. It gives it a flavor that I feel is needed.”

                                                “Everything is minimal and seductive in this track, so once again, I don’t really have to over-think or over-do. On one of the backgrounds I just use a standard Avid Air Chorus, which is a beautiful plug-in, an old school Waves MetaFlanger, doubling up on the flavor, then slight compression from the RCompressor to control it, a Waves HDelay to give it a little bit of a room, and the Waves RVerb. Rosalía sounds really, really organic, so you didn’t want to make it too sensational.”

                                                Moving on to the second most important aspect of the track, the claps, Joshua explains, “The primary instruments in this song are all in the low mid-range, so that already gave the vocal a place to sit. Also, this wasn’t something that was going to be competing with Ariana Grande or Beyoncé or any other radio record. This track had a vibe, and the openness of it is so important. If you compress the claps too much, you would lose the vibe, it wouldn’t be flamenco anymore. It would just be a solid linear clap all the way through.”
                                            </p>

                                                “You’re so tempted to put the Brainworx on and dip out the middle and add shit and maybe put a chorus on it. But it was like, ‘stay out the way.’ There’s no hi-hat in this song, so you need the top on the claps to keep the high end. Usually when I have a hi-hat, I like identifying what the hi-hat is going to be, and rolling a little bit of that off, so there’s separation between the claps in the hi-hat.”

                                                The main inserts on <a href="https://mixwiththemasters.com/videos/jaycen-joshua-rosalia-malamente/part/2?at=565" target="_blank"><b>the clap loop</b></a> are the Waves CLA-76, Lo-Fi, Pro-Q2, SoundToys PanMan and Pro-Q. Joshua elaborates, “The session came with the Waves CLA 76. It was barely touching it. It jumps just a little bit, not even half a DB. Pablo used it for the tone, and I respect that and left it. Then, when you are recording claps or anything like that with really good mics, sometimes it comes out too clean. It has no character.”

                                                “This record had a Timbaland vibe where all the instruments and parts don’t sound hi-fi or great, but they work well together. That vibe is super, super important. In this track the claps were mono, and in a high-mid frequency. I didn’t want it to step on the lead vocal, so I added a SoundToys PanMan, that takes it from left to right to give it movement. There’s also a front-to-back pattern on the claps, from a short room reverb, that again gives you movement. In headphones, it's a very, very seductive thing.

                                                “When you have a front-to-back panner or reverb on a primary instrument that people focus on, it gives you a sense of it coming behind you, it going forward, it going side to side, while her vocal stays  in the middle. The clap is basically doing a flamenco dance around her vocal, if that makes any sense.”

                                                In the Mix With The Masters video, Joshua elaborates on his vocal and clap treatments, as well as on details of his treatments of the other <a href="https://mixwiththemasters.com/videos/jaycen-joshua-rosalia-malamente/part/4?at=3" target="_blank"><b>drum tracks</b></a>, the <a href="https://mixwiththemasters.com/videos/jaycen-joshua-rosalia-malamente/part/2?at=250" target="_blank"><b>synth</b></a> parts, and his <a href="https://mixwiththemasters.com/videos/jaycen-joshua-rosalia-malamente/part/5?at=820" target="_blank"><b>master bus</b></a>, offering a wealth of indispensable and very practical information with great clarity. Towards the end of the video, Pensado remarks, “After spending this time with you, it feels to me that there's not one big, ‘oh my God, this plugin changed the world.’ It’s a lot of little tiny things.” 
                                            </p>

                                                Joshua replies, “Less is more, and if you want to take five or 10dB off, and instead of doing it all at once, you use two plugins, it sounds more musical. Also, in the loudness wars you want to go as loud as you can, but your perception of loudness actually comes from the transients. A lot of people say, ‘Man, I’m loud. I have a brick wall. So why don’t I sound loud?’ It’s because they have their stereo bus limiter doing everything and they’re decapitating all the transients. Instead, you want all your work to be done on your individual drum bus, your individual music bus, your individual vocal bus. You want all that compression and all that limiting done before it hits the master bus. By the time it gets to your final destination limiter, you really, really don’t want to do too much.”

                                                Joshua concludes, “Once you become a mixer, the first thing that you realize is that you’ll never listen to music the same way again. Every time you listen to a record, you’re hearing the faults or you’re hearing the successes. Our job as mixers is to fix all the mistakes and try our best and our taste to make it flawless. But all of us can also go back to when we were a kid, and we had no idea what compression was, or what levels or crispy vocals were. We just listened to a record and said, ‘Hey, we like it!’ Sometimes you have to re-teach yourself that.”
