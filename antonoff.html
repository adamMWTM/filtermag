The moment you record something, you’re literally not in the room. Instead you’re trying to get a picture of the sound in the room. For example, if I were to draw you and it looks exactly like a photograph, you’d say ‘wow, you’re so talented.’ But you wouldn’t feel touched. But if Picasso were to draw you, and your eyes are here and your mouth is there, it’s more important than a perfect image or a photograph.”

                                                “When you hear something in the room, you want to capture a quality in it that is bigger than the sound of it. You want to capture the soul of it, right? If you capture the perfect sound of it, you’re the best recording engineer of all time, but there’s actually something more important, which is feeling. And that feeling is best captured when you don’t overthink things. Don’t wait for the perfect tempo, or tone, or this or that—just record.”

                                                Antonoff is, of course, well-known as one of the leading songwriters and producers in pop music, a man with the Midas touch, who has been credited by the BBC with “redefining” pop music. Antonoff has worked with artists like Taylor Swift, Lorde, Lana del Rey, St Vincent, Sia, and many others, and also releases his own music under monikers like Bleachers and Red Hearse. He has won an amazing eight Grammy Awards.

                                                Antonoff co-wrote six and co-produced ten songs on <i>Dance Fever</i>. He started work with singer and band leader Florence Welch in 2020, and “King” was the first song they came up with. In an <a href="http://mwtm.com/itt79" target="_blank"><b>in-depth documentary</b></a> on Mix With The Masters, Antonoff describes their process in detail, highlighting and playing the relevant parts in the Pro Tools production session, with details of the plugins that were used, and explaining his thought process behind each part and each sonic treatment. In the process Antonoff offered a number of reflections that are food for thought for any songwriter and/or producer.

                                                “Florence and I talked a lot. We were talking ideas, like the idea of ‘thread of tension.’ We got into the studio together, and ‘King’ became the proof of the concept. It became the mission statement for the entire album. Every bit of the song is a jumping-off point for other parts of the album. It was the moment in the studio when the thoughts that were in her head and in my head became sounds we could agree on. Thank God we were hearing the same things!”

                                                “We had these ideas, but like always, what mattered was the song, outside of the sound of it. We were in RAK Studios in London, and I sat down at the piano, playing basic block chords, and she had her book of poems and she was singing. That’s <a href="https://mixwiththemasters.com/videos/jack-antonoff-florence-the-machine-king/part/1?at=98" target="_blank"><b>how the song was written</b></a>. Once we had mapped out the block piano and vocal line, we started putting some of our ideas to the test.”

                                                “The first thing was, what is the ‘thread of tension?’ In my mind it was a 16th note pulse behind a calming bass line. I did both on the Roland Juno-60. It is my favourite synth to get low end from. It’s kind of sacrilegious, but I think it beats a Moog! The Juno beautifully fills up the sub range without eating the track. So the ‘thread of tension’ is this big sound of the low notes from the Juno, then the 16th note, pulsing arp (arpeggio), also from the Juno, and then the piano block chords.”

                                                While playing each of these parts from the Pro Tools session, Antonoff elaborates on the underlying meaning that Welch gave to “King,” and how this impacted the production. In interviews Welch has explained that the title and concept of <i>Dance Fever</i> were inspired by something called choreomania, also known as ‘dancing plague,’ which was a strange social phenomenon that took place over several centuries in Europe, many centuries ago, with groups of people inexplicably dancing to the point of exhaustion, and worse.

                                                “The first thing Florence talked to me about was this bit of history where people danced themselves to death, it was like total feral mania. There was this information about the darkness in her lyrics and what this album was going to be. The 16th note pulse and low bass notes and piano chords felt like this blend of mania and darkness, where it’s like, ‘I don’t know if I’m supposed to be dancing to this or slitting my throat!’”

                                                While talking about the four elements occupying the low end — piano, bass guitar, Juno bass notes and Juno pulse — Antonoff goes off on another mind-bend, challenging people’s preconceived notions about <a href="https://mixwiththemasters.com/videos/jack-antonoff-florence-the-machine-king/part/1?at=400" target="_blank"><b>low end and how to treat it</b></a>.

                                                “Sometimes people get caught up in the idea of low end as singular, I think because low end is scary. When people were teaching me how to record, they would say, ‘you can have all these different drums, and you can layer guitars and pianos, and vocals, and you can do all these things.’ But when it came to the bass, it was, ‘the bass player plays the bass parts.’”

                                               “The reason is that it’s very easy to layer pianos, and whether you spread them out or have them in the middle, they will sound cool, but if I play two basses, they are going to sound like shit. Usually, the idea is to make your low end feel warm and great and have it glue the song together. That is true. But low end is also a place to explore, and in my opinion it’s one of the most important places to explore.”

                                                “Very often, in my songs and mixes and productions, I find a space where the low end is a cast of characters. Rather than one bass or one sub that’s perfectly treated and rounded, I like to give it a character that feels very unique to me. I encourage people to try this. You fail nine out of ten times, but when you get it right you can get rubs and harmonic tones that you can't create in another way.”

                                                “When you get rubbing low notes, you get into certain frequencies where you don’t know what you’re hearing as much that you’re feeling it. So I added some grit to the bass guitar in this song, and altogether all these low end parts create this murky space that I love. It’s a whole cast of characters that almost sounds like an army marching.”

                                                Antonoff spends a lot of time in the MWTM series talking about the low end, for example also explaining, “The other thing about creating low end worlds with more than one instrument is that you get to <a href="https://mixwiththemasters.com/videos/jack-antonoff-florence-the-machine-king/part/2?at=135" target="_blank"><b>play with panning</b></a>. In this track, the Junos are in stereo, and my bass is 22% to the left. That’s pretty subtle compared to what I normally do. The idea of panning low end instruments is as unorthodox as the idea of stacking low end instruments, but it’s something I did a lot with Bleachers.”

                                                “You do have to be careful when panning low end, because you don’t want to make people nauseous. But it’s a way to experiment with which you can immediately make your recordings feel different than other recordings that are happening. Obviously, we’re in the Atmos renaissance, but I feel like the stereo field has gotten less experimental than it necessarily was in the seventies.”

My initial idea for the vocal was to have it almost awkwardly dry, but then I put a ValhallaRoom on it, and it sounded just beautiful. In fact, Florence is singing about ‘my empty halls to echo with grand self-mythology.’ Sometimes you want the production and the sound of the song to do what it’s saying. I hear her in a castle running down the halls, swinging a sword, being a maniac.”

I played <a href="https://mixwiththemasters.com/videos/jack-antonoff-florence-the-machine-king/part/3?at=60" target="_blank"><b>the drums</b></a> as if I was listening to a record with my headphones and playing along in my house.

                                                “There’s a SoundToys FilterFreak on the kick, because I wanted to connect it to the sub frequency of my Juno. The real sauce to these drums is on my overheads, which I have coming and going. I probably went in and was drawing it and pulling it in and out. I also added the same ValhallaRoom that’s on the vocal, not terribly different in the setting. If something sounds really good on the vocal, put it on other instruments as well.”

Treat them as separate things, almost as samples, and you get a picture of a drum set that has a pretty wide range. The drums here have the energy of one person playing because it literally is, but there are enough different tones happening on each thing that it feels kind of like sitting with an MPC and just throwing a bunch of different samples together. Because essentially it's what I’ve done. I’ve treated the kick like it’s part of a different drum kit. I’ve treated the overheads like they’re part of a different drum kit. It created this world that felt very live, but also kind of pop.”

                                                According to Antonoff, he’s using the ValhallaRoom on everything in the “King” session, because, he says, “it was very clear that we wanted to put everything in a place, in a room, in a hallway, in a castle somewhere, where you imagine Florence. If you introduce a different reverb or a different distortion, your average person is not going to know necessarily what you did, but they’re going to know that there’s a sound that has left that zone. Sometimes it’s the joy of having a million different things hitting and making all these different tones. It's a beautiful technique if you’re trying to expand the palette, but a deadly technique if you’re trying to stay in a place.”

It’s the sound of us writing the song on the piano. It’s the sound of her voice beautifully recorded through a CM7. It’s the sound of a cast of characters creating the low end. But the one place where the song really opens up and shines is the outro. To me, this needed to sound like a circus, a carnival.”

I do a combination of explaining what I need and asking them to fuck around. I asked Evan for a ‘Sgt Pepper’s’ eighth note staccato, sort of chugging around the whole thing. I usually at least want him to double my bass with a baritone. There also are tenor saxophones. He’s basically creating the chords. The horns are completely dry. They didn't get touched.”

                                                “From Bobby I wanted a ‘Magical Mystery Tour,’ ‘Sgt. Pepper’-type of scratchy thing. I hate it when strings are recorded too clean. I like when you can hear the bow. Almost as important as the note, to me, is to hear the player, because I very rarely use strings to be beautiful. If I want strings to be beautiful, I'll often do them on a Mellotron or something synthetic, because it sounds more like a dream to me. When I have a real string player, I actually want to hear the person struggling, almost like the way Neil Young plays guitar to get the notes out.”

                                                Towards the end of the video, Antonoff talks about <a href="https://mixwiththemasters.com/videos/jack-antonoff-florence-the-machine-king/part/5?at=400" target="_blank"><b>mixing and mastering</b></a>. Among other things, he points to a treatment he and his engineer Laura Sisk added. Unusually, it was to the rough mix.

                                                “I want to point out something that’s really cool about this end transition. It’s the ultimate thread of tension. I did something that I do a lot, which is to put something on the whole track. I don’t think anyone should be afraid to put shit on the master. Right here, I have a SoundToys Echoboy on the actual master. The song is getting to this transition, and I wanted it dirtier, more messed up. I drew the effect in for that moment, and it creates the same feeling like when I'm messing with a Watkins Copicat.”
                                            </p>

                                                “This is controversial. Obviously, we’re using our [rough mix] master to add EQ and compress and fake mastering plug-ins, to glue the thing together a little bit. But when you add another kind of treatment, like Echoboy or a SoundToys Tremolator, it immediately can make something incredibly odd and cool, and sound like the whole track is moving in one direction. In this track that one transitional moment was right, just using the Echoboy.”

                                                “I'm always encouraging people to fuck with the entire track. So if you don’t think a song feels alive enough in the room, just do an experiment. Put a reverb on the master. Just put it in the room, and listen to what the hell is interesting about it. Every once in a while I just want to put a chorus on the entire track. The vibe is remarkable. Do these things post mix, right before a master. Anyone who says to lay off of the Master Bus is afraid.”

No one touch that.’ At other times, you take something to a mixer because you want it torn apart, as it’s really not working. So I'll either mix the track myself with Laura, or I send it to someone with the instruction to just push it a little further, just a little more glue, a little more hi-fi, a little more rounded out, or I want the full works, and I say to the mixer, ‘Go to fucking town.
