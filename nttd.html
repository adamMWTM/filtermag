                                            <p>
                                                Eilish was 18 at the time of the song's release, making her the youngest artist ever to sing and write a Bond theme song. Finneas, at just 22, was most likely the youngest songwriter and producer to be involved. 
                                            </p>

                                                "No Time To Die" became a major hit all over the world, and was showered with awards, winning Acadamy, Critics' Choice, Golden Globe, Grammy, and many other awards, all in the Best Original Song or similar category. The song became one of the classic theme songs of the Bond franchise, which has been going since 1962. <i>No Time To Die</i> was the 25th film in the series.

                                                Finneas talks about the fact that writing a Bond theme song had always been a dream for him and his sister, and describes their excitement when they were first asked by film producer Barbara Broccoli to submit a song. They <a href="https://mixwiththemasters.com/videos/hans-zimmer-billie-eilish-no-time-to-die/part/1?at=177" target="_blank"><b>wrote and recorded a demo</b></a> version in October 2019 while on tour, in Austin, Texas. The recording was done in the bunk of their tour bus, using just Finneas's mobile rig, consisting of a Logic set-up, monitors, a midi controller, a soundcard and a Neumann TLM 103 microphone. 
                                            </p>
                                            
                                            <p>
                                                Finneas' and Eilish's minimalist demo was sent to legendary film composer Hans Zimmer, who recalls that it was "emotionally precise, and I just loved that it was quiet." Zimmer invited the duo over to continue work on the song, remarking, "I always support the artist's vision, as opposed to imposing my own. So we worked as equals." Finneas calls it "a cool experience." 
                                            </p>
                                            
                                            <p>
                                                Zimmer also invited British mixer and producer Stephen Lipson to work on the track, whose credits include Paul McCartney, Annie Lennox, and Robbie Williams. Lipson suggested tempo changes for greater dramatic effect, which he demonstrates <a href="https://mixwiththemasters.com/videos/hans-zimmer-billie-eilish-no-time-to-die/part/2?at=36" target="_blank"><b>in the video</b></a>, and added several instruments to the track, including a guitar part by Johnny Marr. 
                                            </p>

                                                The inclusion of an orchestra is obligatory for a Bond song, and Zimmer worked hard to honor the early Bond scores by John Barry, while also taking the arrangement into the 21st century. However, getting the details of the orchestral arrangement exactly right turned out to be a major challenge. 
                                            </p>

                                                In the end there were three <a href="https://mixwiththemasters.com/videos/hans-zimmer-billie-eilish-no-time-to-die/part/3?at=440" target="_blank"><b>orchestral arrangements</b></a>, which were recorded at Air Lyndhurst Studios in London. Lipson remarks, "We did six passes of each arrangement, so that's 18 passes, at around 100 tracks per pass..."

                                                Lipson and Finneas worked out a way to <a href="https://mixwiththemasters.com/videos/hans-zimmer-billie-eilish-no-time-to-die/part/3?at=775" target="_blank"><b>combine all three orchestral arrangements</b></a>, and Steve Mazzaro added some sampled orchestral parts. After seeing the entire movie, Eilish re-sang her vocal part.

                                                Zimmer remarks, "We kept a lot of the demo, but her new vocal performance was very much influenced by the story and the actors and the camerawork. Her finished master is remarkable. She did not over-sing it, but brought a new level of commitment."
                                            </p>
                                            
                                            <p>
                                                Lipson then <a href="https://mixwiththemasters.com/videos/hans-zimmer-billie-eilish-no-time-to-die/part/5" target="_blank"><b>mixed the entire session</b></a>, which, he says, "involved lots of automation. It was a lot of work, also not to take away from but enhance the atmosphere of Billie and Finneas's original demo."
                                            </p>

                                                With the recordings complete and a mix approved, the last hurdle was to get the endorsement of Bond actor Daniel Craig. At this point there were still several other songs in the running. Lipson describes how he spent another two hours making several changes, "retaining Billie and Finneas' sensibilities while Bonding up the track," literally minutes before the dramatic moment when Craig enters the studio and listens for the first time, with everyone present in the studio on tenterhooks. 
                                            </p>

                                                Finneas adds, "Lipson did the film mix, while Rob Kinelski mixed the version that came out on Spotify, iTunes and so on. So Rob did the primary mix for us."

                                                Kinelski is Eilish and Finneas' regular mixer, and clearly a trusted pair of hands for them. His work with the duo has earned Kinelski several Grammy Awards.

                                                In the last segment of the making of "No Time To Die" documentary, Kinelski goes into great detail about <a href="https://mixwiththemasters.com/videos/hans-zimmer-billie-eilish-no-time-to-die/part/6" target="_blank"><b>his mix of the song</b></a>. Similar to the remarks made by Zimmer and Lipson, Kinelski also repeatedly stresses the importance of honoring the vibe of the original demo during his mix process.

                                                "The main comment from Billie and Finneas as I went into this mix was that they wanted to recapture the energy of the original demo, which had a moody, darker kind of vibe. The final vocals had been processed in a way that was different to where the demo had been, and the goal for me was to recapture the vibe of the original vocals. Of course, because I had been working with Billie and Finneas for a long time, I was very comfortable with the way they like things to sound."

                                                Kinelski grew up on the East Coast, and after playing in a band during high school, he went to the SAE Institute of Technology in New York. Following this he got a job at Sony Music Studios, where he often worked on consoles. "That's where I got my chops up," recalls Kinelski. He moved to LA in 2009, were he worked for RocNation and with producer No ID. Since 2013 he's worked as an independent mixer, with credits like Big Sean, Logic, Nas, and Lil Durk.

                                                Kinelski's experience of mixing on desks has led to an ongoing search for that analogue magic when working in the box. It means that he uses a lot of Dangerous outboard, as he describes in the video documentary.

"I'm summing my instruments, breaking them down into groups, into the Dangerous, and then I bring it back into Pro Tools. I go through analogue because something happens in the mix. It's subtle, but there's more depth and a slight color. It just feels bit more musical and interesting."

"I received the vocals dry, and did my best to bring them to an organic place. Billie has an incredible voice, and it's one of those voices that, when it's recorded well, it doesn't need much. There's a clarity in the way she delivers. Because Finneas tends to record all her vocals with her, they always have it dialed in."

                                                "They like a dark vibe, and I try to stay true to that. Sometimes I have to get rid of some mud, like low mids, but because their productions tend to have darkness in them, her vocal naturally stands out without needing much help. In this song, her vocal had already been processed slightly brighter than I think Billie and Finneas are used to, so I did a little more EQ-ing than I normally do, to get back to the original vibe." 
                                            </p>

                                                "As you can see in the session, there's quite a bit of editing and volume automation on the main vocal stem. The inserts on the vocal stem start with the FabFilter Pro-Q3, with some pretty aggressive treatment in the top end.  There are many EQ points, because I'm trying to subtly carve out things to match the tone from the demo."

                                                "I'm taking out 4.5dB at 4.8kHz. which is quite a bit. The other EQ points are subtle moves: -1.5dB at 10.5kHz, -1dB at 6.9kHz, -0.1dB at 5.6kHz, -1.3dB at 3037Hz. I also added a 1dB at 266Hz +1dB, but I'm using the dynamic EQ so it's also catching some of the low mids that poke out a little bit. It's all very subtle."

                                                The vocal stem is sent to an aux track called LV, on which Kinelski enacts most of his vocal treatments. "It is really simple," he says. "I'm doing a high pass filter with the Pro-Q2 at about 80 Hz, and after that I'm using the Waves PuigChild 670 compressor, the Waves DeEsser, the Waves SSL E-Channel cutting a little bit of low mids and a little bit of top end. Then there's more of the Pro-Q2, once again with many subtle moves to get it to sit right, to match the tone of the demo."

                                                "Next is the UAD Neve 1073, purely for color. A lot of times, I'll use the filter on this as well, and maybe add a little top end. But in this case, I left it alone. Finally, there's the Waves Vocal Rider, to give a little movement to the vocal. It also lifts some of the lower volumes, but it still keeps the vocal dynamic. I did tons of volume rides on this LV aux. It was all about getting it in the right place and giving it life."

                                                "I also have some sends on the LV aux. There's a send to a Doubler aux, which has the SoundToys MicroShift. I've used this a lot on Billie's vocals in the past. It just adds a hair of width. I turn it up, but the moment you can hear it in the song, it's too loud, and I back it down. It's a feeling. There's also a send to a Stereo Room aux, which has the Valhalla Room, on which I used a high cut, so it's darker. There's also a lot of automation on the returns as well just, to give a little bit more movement so this is not just a linear experience."

I adjusted the timing of that delay with the Time Adjuster, to get the groove right, and I took out some low mids with the Pro-Q3, because the 8th note delay was getting in the way of the vocal a bit. After that there's an aux track called Dirty Echo which has the SoundToys Echoboy with the Dirt Echo preset, and I carved out some low end on that with the Pro-Q3. I also added the SoundToys PanMan, giving some  randomness in the stereo field, and then I made that super wide with the Waves S1 Imager, for more interest."

                                                Kinelski gives more details of his vocal treatments in the video, and he also highlights many of his treatments on the piano, synths, strings, guitar, and drums. He then demonstrates how they get sent to eight aux group tracks: DBuss 1-2 (Drums), DBuss 3-4 (Bass), DBuss 5-6 (Guitars), DBuss 7-8 (Keys), DBus 9-10 (LV), all the way to DBuss 16 (FX Returns).

                                                "All these aux tracks have the Slate Digital Virtual Channel on them," says Kinelski, "just set to default. I've been doing this for a long time, to try to re-create the analogue experience of mixing on a console. It adds another layer of colour."

                                                The eight group tracks are sent to Kinelski's Dangerous 2-Bus, and come back in the session, from where everything is sent to Kinelski's two +PRINT tracks, -LOUD and -LL (Less Limited), and from which the mixes are printed.

                                                "Both PRINT tracks have exactly the same chain, except for the FabFilter Pro-L2 limiter, which is turned down on the LL version. I print both mixes, and send both to the mastering engineer, so he can choose whether he wants to use the LOUD mix, which everyone working on the song has heard, or work with the print that has more headroom."

But it adds a little bit of life and color. After that, I go on to the UAD Culture Vulture, which also adds a hair of color. It's super subtle. All I know is that when I bypass it, I miss it."

What's distorting?' Instead of the overall mix volume being an issue, distortion might only be happening in one place. Often the vocal and the bass are sharing a harmonic that's pushing the whole mix into distortion."

And once you start pulling things out that don't need to be there, you're taking away stacked frequencies of unnecessary sound. So you're getting a clearer sound and the mix gets louder. But also,  I use great mastering engineers. Shout out to John Greenham and Dave Kutch, and other guys as well. They're the people that are really making the volume work."
